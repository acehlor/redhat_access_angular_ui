#STEPS

 1. modify strata.js to support wider variety of queries - either let it specify all fields or let it **support our query language**
 2. modify common and pcm modules to support our query language
 3. build an UI for building/editing of queries
 
 
The idea:
 - let the user specify any possible query over a set of searchable (and sortable) fields. A UI clickable query is an option,
 however, I feel a plain text input (with heavy autocompletion) is maybe better?
 
Important decisions: 
1. choice of the query language
2. where to put the parser (where to resolve into solr query, or set of search parameters)

Possible solutions:
 1. Why not use **SOLR queries** in UI? There may already be an angular component for this. Possible advantage is we can 
 dynamically fetch available fields/values, depends on the services at use atm. Also no need for converting into SOLR query 
 (some validation/permissions or field renaming might be needed though).
    1.1 pre-set fields with basic autocompletion would work
 2. Something like http://mfauveau.github.io/angular-query-builder/ (more of an **in-house solution**), this can (has to) 
 be combined with custom parser and plain text input (with autocompletions). 
 Parser can also provide autocompletions (e.g. as in the UNIFIED CLI).
 
Needed:
 - SOLR format - syntax is OK, what about sorting?
 - current system SOLR docs - what are the permissible fields, what are the domains (e.g. if searching for user?), 
    which are allowed to be searched by whom, where (how) can I test e.t.c.
 
To be careful of:
 - Extensibility
 - Nothing too crazy
 
Useful stuff
 - PEG.js -> create SOLR Query simplified grammar, can be used for verification AND autocompletion

## Refined version of SOLR grammar, enables creating and/or sequences without brackets
query = sequence

sequence = sequencePart sequenceCont
sequenceCont = orSequence / andSequence / ""

andSequence = (" and " sequencePart)+
orSequence = (" or " sequencePart)+
sequencePart = criteria / "(" sequence ")"


criteria = basicCriteria / notCriteria
notCriteria = "-"basicCriteria 
basicCriteria = fieldName ":"" "* string 

string = "\""[^\"]*"\""
fieldName = "text" / "ownerName" / "status" / "dateOpened" / "statusDescription" / "ownerEmail"
